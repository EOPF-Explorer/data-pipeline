# Data Pipeline: Gaps Analysis & Priority Roadmap

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Context:** Against Devseed SOW and production deployment requirements
**Status:** Pipeline operational, but production-readiness gaps identified

---

## Executive Summary

The data-pipeline successfully achieves core SOW Task 1 deliverables (GeoZarr conversion, STAC integration, Argo orchestration). However, **critical production gaps** exist in operations, monitoring, testing, and documentation that risk operational stability and maintainability.

**Severity Scale:** üî¥ Critical | üü° Important | üü¢ Nice-to-have

---

## 1. CRITICAL GAPS (Block Production) üî¥

### 1.1 Missing Alerting & On-Call Runbooks
**Impact:** No way to detect/respond to failures in production
**Evidence:**
- Prometheus metrics exist but NO alerts configured
- No PagerDuty/Slack integration
- No runbooks for common failure modes
- Silent failures possible (see OBSERVABILITY.md SLOs but no actual alerts)

**Action Required:**
```yaml
# Missing: platform-deploy/core/monitoring/alerts/data-pipeline-alerts.yaml
- alert: GeozarrWorkflowFailureRate
  expr: rate(geozarr_conversion_failures[5m]) > 0.1
  for: 5m
  annotations:
    runbook_url: https://docs.../runbook-conversion-failures
```

**Priority:** P0 - Deploy before production launch
**Effort:** 2-3 days (alerts + 3-4 runbooks)

---

### 1.2 No Disaster Recovery / Data Loss Prevention
**Impact:** Catastrophic data loss possible, no rollback capability
**Evidence:**
- No S3 versioning mentioned in platform-deploy configs
- No backup strategy for STAC catalog (pgSTAC database)
- No way to reprocess failed items after >1 hour (workflow retention unclear)
- No "undo" for incorrect STAC registrations

**Missing:**
- S3 bucket lifecycle policies
- STAC database backup automation
- Failed workflow replay mechanism
- Item deletion/correction procedures

**Priority:** P0 - Required for production
**Effort:** 1 week (infra + procedures + testing)

---

### 1.3 CI/CD Pipeline Incomplete
**Impact:** Cannot safely deploy updates, high regression risk
**Current State:**
- ‚úÖ Unit tests exist (8 files for 9 scripts)
- ‚úÖ GitHub Actions test workflow
- ‚ùå **No integration tests in CI** (test_pipeline_e2e.py not run automatically)
- ‚ùå **No Docker build on merge to main** (build.yml only triggers on tags or manual)
- ‚ùå **No staging deployment automation** (manual kubectl apply required)
- ‚ùå **No rollback strategy** if bad image deployed

**Gaps:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/test.yml missing:
- name: Integration tests
  run: pytest tests/integration/ --s3-bucket=test-bucket
```

**Priority:** P0 - Before next release
**Effort:** 3-4 days

---

### 1.4 Production Secrets Management Immature
**Impact:** Security vulnerability, credential leaks possible
**Evidence:**
- `.work/` directory contains plaintext tokens (argo.token, kubeconfig)
- PAT tokens required for GHCR (added manually, no rotation policy)
- S3 credentials in K8s secrets but no documented rotation procedure
- RabbitMQ password exposed in multiple places

**Required:**
- Vault integration or sealed-secrets for all credentials
- Documented rotation procedures (90-day cycle)
- Remove plaintext secrets from git history audit
- Principle of least privilege review

**Priority:** P0 - Security audit required
**Effort:** 1 week

---

## 2. IMPORTANT GAPS (Operational Risk) üü°

### 2.1 Insufficient Test Coverage
**Current:** 8 unit test files, unclear integration coverage
**Missing:**
- **No S1 GRD conversion tests** (only S2 mentioned in docs)
- **No failure injection tests** (what happens when STAC API is down?)
- **No load/stress tests** (how many concurrent workflows can cluster handle?)
- **No data validation tests** (GeoZarr spec compliance automated testing)
- Integration tests exist but not run in CI

**Metric:** Test coverage report shows ~60-70% (estimated from htmlcov), should be >85% for production

**Priority:** P1 - 2-week sprint
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 2.2 Operational Documentation Gaps
**Strong:** ARCHITECTURE.md, OBSERVABILITY.md, README.md
**Weak:**
- **No troubleshooting decision tree** (see README "Common issues" - only 3 items)
- **No capacity planning guide** (how many workflows per node? When to scale?)
- **No cost analysis** (S3 egress, compute costs per item)
- **No performance tuning guide** (when to adjust chunk size, memory limits)
- **No data retention policy** (how long keep GeoZarr outputs?)

**Priority:** P1 - Before handoff to ops team
**Effort:** 1 week (collaborative documentation)

---

### 2.3 No Batch Processing / Backfill Strategy
**Impact:** Cannot efficiently reprocess collections
**Evidence:**
- Workflow templates designed for single-item processing
- No "batch convert all S2 r60m from date range" capability
- Manual kubectl create per item
- No progress tracking for large batch jobs

**Use Case:** SOW requires processing "petabytes of Sentinel imagery" - current approach doesn't scale

**Priority:** P1 - Required for initial bulk load
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks (design + implementation)

---

### 2.4 Limited Observability Beyond Metrics
**Current:** Prometheus metrics, Argo UI logs
**Missing:**
- **No distributed tracing** (workflow spans through convert ‚Üí validate ‚Üí register ‚Üí augment)
- **No structured logging** (logs are print statements, hard to parse)
- **No log aggregation** (Loki/ELK stack not mentioned in platform-deploy)
- **No cost tracking** (S3 costs per collection, compute costs per workflow)

**Priority:** P1 - Improves debugging significantly
**Effort:** 1 week (structured logging + log shipper)

---

### 2.5 Workflow Template Maintenance Complexity
**Issue:** Multiple YAML files with duplicate configuration
**Evidence:**
```
workflows/
  template.yaml           # Main template (6 resource blocks)
  run-s1-test.yaml       # Test workflow
  run-benchmark-test.yaml
  rbac.yaml
  rbac-staging.yaml      # Duplicate RBAC configs
```

**Impact:**
- Resource limit changes must be applied to 6+ places
- High risk of configuration drift between staging/prod
- No schema validation (easy to create invalid YAML)

**Solution:**
- Kustomize overlays (staging/prod inherit from base)
- Helm chart for parameterized deployments
- CI validation of workflow templates

**Priority:** P1 - Tech debt cleanup
**Effort:** 3-4 days

---

## 3. SOW ALIGNMENT GAPS üü°

### 3.1 Task 1 Gaps (Pipeline & Transformation)
**Delivered:** ‚úÖ S1 GRD + S2 L2A support, Argo + Dask, STAC integration, CI/CD, docs
**Missing from SOW:**
- ‚ùå "Optimal chunking and compression strategies identified through testing"
  - No documented benchmarking methodology
  - No A/B test results comparing chunk sizes
  - No justification for chosen compression codec (see data-model README)
- ‚ùå "Automated CI/CD on OVH cloud infrastructure"
  - CI runs on GitHub Actions (not OVH)
  - No automated deployment to OVH cluster
  - Manual kubectl apply still required

**Priority:** P1 - SOW compliance
**Effort:** 1 week (benchmarking + documentation)

---

### 3.2 Task 2 Gaps (Demonstration & Validation)
**Delivered:** ‚úÖ Jupyter notebooks (3), benchmarking tools, validation framework
**Missing from SOW:**
- ‚ùå "Performance comparison between original EOPF and GeoZarr formats"
  - benchmark_geozarr.py exists but no published results
  - No white paper or report showing improvements
  - No before/after metrics in production
- ‚ùå "Working prototype ready for V0 demonstration (September 29)"
  - Delivered late (based on commit history in docs)
  - No V0 demo recording or materials archived

**Priority:** P2 - Deliverable completion
**Effort:** 2-3 days (run benchmarks + write report)

---

### 3.3 Community Engagement Gaps
**SOW Requirements:**
- "Engage with the GeoZarr community to contribute to technical specifications"
- "Participate in standardization working groups"
- "Take on development of the necessary enhancements in existing python libraries"

**Evidence of Gaps:**
- No public PRs to zarr-python, xarray, xpublish (checked GitHub histories)
- No mention of GeoZarr spec contributions in data-model CHANGELOG
- No conference talks, blog posts, or public demos referenced

**Priority:** P2 - SOW requirement
**Effort:** Ongoing quarterly activity

---

## 4. NICE-TO-HAVE IMPROVEMENTS üü¢

### 4.1 Developer Experience
- Pre-commit hooks slow (all checks run even on small changes)
- No local testing environment (Kind/Minikube setup)
- No VS Code devcontainer config
- Notebooks require manual port-forwarding

**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** 2-3 days

---

### 4.2 Performance Optimizations
- Dask cluster configuration not documented (how many workers?)
- No caching layer for frequently accessed source items
- No partial conversion restart (if convert fails at 90%, restart from scratch)
- S3 multipart upload not mentioned (affects large files)

**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** 1-2 weeks

---

### 4.3 Additional Monitoring
- Cost per workflow (compute + storage)
- Quality metrics (GeoZarr compliance score distribution)
- User engagement (tile request patterns from Titiler)
- Data freshness (time from Sentinel acquisition to GeoZarr availability)

**Priority:** P3
**Effort:** 1 week

---

## 5. ARCHITECTURAL CONCERNS

### 5.1 Tight Coupling: data-pipeline ‚Üî data-model
**Issue:** data-pipeline depends on `eopf-geozarr` CLI from data-model, but:
- No versioning contract (what if CLI changes?)
- Docker image includes both repos (update one = rebuild both)
- No compatibility matrix documented

**Recommendation:**
- Semantic versioning for eopf-geozarr CLI
- Separate Docker images (data-model base, data-pipeline extends)
- Integration tests across version combinations

**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** 3-4 days

---

### 5.2 Single Point of Failure: STAC API
**Issue:** Entire pipeline blocks if STAC API unavailable
**Evidence:**
- No retry with exponential backoff in register_stac.py
- No circuit breaker pattern
- No fallback to queue registration requests

**Recommendation:**
- Implement tenacity retry decorator (exists but not used everywhere)
- Add dead-letter queue for failed registrations
- STAC API health check before workflow submission

**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** 2-3 days

---

### 5.3 Resource Limits May Be Insufficient
**Current:** 6Gi memory request / 10Gi limit for conversion
**Concern:** S2 r10m full tile may exceed limits for large datasets
**Evidence:** Template.yaml shows fixed limits, but no autoscaling mentioned

**Recommendation:**
- Document memory requirements per collection/resolution
- Add resource request scaling based on input size
- Configure HPA for workflow pods (if supported by Argo)

**Priority:** P2
**Effort:** 2-3 days (profiling + documentation)

---

---

## 10. CONCLUSION

The data-pipeline is **functionally complete** but **operationally immature**. Core technical requirements from the SOW are met, but production deployment risks are significant without:

1. **Alerting & incident response procedures** (P0)
2. **Disaster recovery mechanisms** (P0)
3. **Automated deployment pipeline** (P0)
4. **Comprehensive operational documentation** (P1)

**Recommended Path Forward:**
- **Immediate:** 2-week production readiness sprint (Sprint 1 above)
- **Short-term:** 4-week operational stability phase (Sprints 2-3)
- **Long-term:** Continuous improvement + SOW compliance (Sprint 4+)

**Resource Requirements:**
- 1 senior engineer (full-time, 8 weeks)
- 1 devops engineer (part-time, 4 weeks)
- 1 technical writer (part-time, 2 weeks)

**Estimated Timeline to Production-Ready:** 6-8 weeks

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-18
**Review Cycle:** Every 2 weeks during roadmap execution
